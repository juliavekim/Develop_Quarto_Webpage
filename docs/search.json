    "text": "Pulsating Red Giants in a Globular Cluster: \\(\\omega\\) Centauri\n Image courtesy of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica here.\nAASVO Publication\nAbstract: We carried out light-curve and time-series analysis of a sample of 16 pulsating red giants (PRGs) in the globular cluster \\(\\omega\\) Cen, using observations from the ASAS-SN database, and the AAVSO software package VStar. Of the 16 stars, 1 was classified by ASAS-SN as Mira (M), 5 as semiregular (SR), and 10 as ‚Äúlong secondary period‚Äù (LSP), i.e., the dominant period was an LSP. We determined pulsation periods (P) for all of them, secondary pulsation periods for 3, possible secondary pulsation periods for 4, and LSPs for 8. This confirms that LSPs are common in Population II stars. In the context of a recent model for LSPs, this implies that many Population II PRGs had planetary companions which accreted gas and dust to become brown dwarfs or lowmass stars, now enshrouded by dust. In this model, the LSP is the orbital period of the hypothetical companion. The amplitudes of the pulsation periods vary by up to a factor of 3.4 on a median time scale of 18 pulsation periods, for reasons unknown. The ratios of LSP/P cluster around 4 and 8, presumably depending on whether P is a fundamental mode or first overtone period. We have augmented our sample with a few stars from the literature to plot period-luminosity relations. Sequences for LSPs, fundamental, and first-overtone pulsation periods are visible. Our results show that the complex variability of the PRGs in \\(\\omega\\) Cen is similar to that of red giants in other stellar systems, and in the field."

Bottom-dwelling organisms in coastal regions are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts, being both impacted by open ocean and near-surface terrestrial dynamics. Arctic coastal ecosystems, for instance, have experienced sea ice loss, increasing glacial runoff, permafrost melt and erosion, producing ecological cascades that ripple through the marine ecosystem. Here, we present research supported by a growing body of literature suggestive of recent barium (Ba) depletion trends in coastal waters, resulting from larger and longer-lasting phytoplankton blooms. We produce a barium-calcium ratio(Ba/Ca) record from specimens of calcifying coralline red algae (Clathromorphum compactum) collected in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago that show a gradual decrease of barium since the mid-20th century. We suggest that this trend results from the increasing uptake of barium by pelagic (surface-dwelling) phytoplankton, as a consequence of reduced sea ice and increased terrestrial nutrient input from permafrost melt. Contextualized within the wider literature, we propose this algal record as a multi-centennial phytoplankton bloom proxy time series for this region. As we consider future Arctic ecological scenarios, the intensification of phytoplankton blooms may have cascading impacts on coastal marine organisms competing for surface nutrients and light access (e.g., coastal darkening), upper trophic organisms such as seabirds, and Indigenous livelihoods.\nPaper is in pre-print, publication link is to follow shortly."

Next year, I will embark on doctoral studies in one of these three fields of study, very likely in the United States. I am presently sitting my interviews for my graduate programs, being fortunate enough to have already received some letters of admissions from Ph.D.¬†programs at Yale and Stanford.\nIn my graduate studies, I intend to specialise in the study of random systems and stochastic methods. My primary interest in this field arises from its tremendous applicability, in which it seeks to give a mathematical analysis of the intuitive notions of ‚Äúchance‚Äù or ‚Äúrandomness‚Äù that are pertinent to almost every branch of knowledge. More specifically, I wish to focus on stochastic modelling and computation and, in particular, the foundations of machine learning. I hope to explore its applications to important problems in data science, finance or physical systems, with an eye to extracting information useful for modelling and prediction.\nDuring my time at the University of Toronto, I have learnt to greatly enjoy the academic life. This led me to take on a wide variety of research work, from economics to astronomy, in each of which I have been required to speculate over questions, for which solutions were unknown or not yet fully developed. My research projects have required me to perform intensive literature review, give presentations at conferences, and partake in the writing of three scientific papers for publication. More about my research projects can be found in the Research section.\nPresently, I am eager to contiue my academic journey abroad and to help advance knowledge in my chosen field. I look very much forward to the opportunities and challenges that lie in my doctoral studies and beyond. üöÄ\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to further discuss."
